# Ng2Pack

a collection of **flexible UI components** and **low-level utilities** (e.g. pipes, services, and directives).

Ng2Pack helps you by many common tasks during the development in Angular 2.

### Main characteristics

We value flexibility above all! In order to ensure it in various use cases:
  - Components accept a **wide range of inputs** and/or configuration, including internationalization.
  - High-level components are usually composed of **smaller components** that can be used separately.
  - **Low-level utilities** make building and composing components faster and easier
  - Last but not least, you can use **custom templates** while taking advantage of component public API, smaller components or low-level utilities.
  Then you should be able to easily customize components to your desire and use them regardless of your CSS framework.   

Additionally, we follow good practices and style guides:

- **Well-tested**: Both comprehensive test suite and usability testing are necessary to verify that the components work as expected.
- **Testable** Your application should be tested as well and this library will not stand in your way, just the opposite.
- **Convention over configuration**: You should have an easy start despite many inputs and configuration. Intelligent defaults are provided.

<!-- There are many other important characteristics (e.g. performance) that are not mentioned here as a main characteristic, but not neglected. -->
